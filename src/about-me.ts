Dear AutoData Hr,
My name is Erasyl, and I am a 4th-year student at KBTU, majoring in Information Systems.
As part of an academic project, I led a startup where I worked as a frontend developer and designer.
I have completed several courses, including Golang Development, Web Development, UI/UX Design, JavaScript and React,
as well as "Technological Entrepreneurship and Startups" and Power BI. Additionally,
I completed the "DataArt" QA Engineering course, where I learned all the responsibilities of a tester. 
I also have a strong command of English, as I lived in the U.S. for 8 months.
I am eager to apply my knowledge and experience to your project!
Best regards,
Yerassyl
